##CREEP 

###by Radiohead

*When you were here before*

*Couldn't look you in the eye*

*You're just like an angel*

*Your skin makes me cry*

*You float like a feather*

*In a beautiful whirl*

*I wish I was special*

*You're so fucking special*

<br>

*But I'm a creep*

*I'm a weirdo*

*What the hell am I doing here?*

*I don't belong here*

<br>

*I don't care if it hurts*

*I want to have control*

*I want a perfect body*

*I want a perfect soul*

*I want you to notice when I'm not around*

*You're so fucking special*

*I wish I was special*

<br>

*But I'm a creep*

*I'm a weirdo*

*What the hell am I doing here?*

*I don't belong here*

<br>

*She's running out the door*

*She's running*

*She runs runs runs runs*

*Runs*

<br>

*Runs*

<br>

*Whatever makes you happy*

*Whatever you want*

*You're so fucking special*

*I wish I was special*

<br>

*But I'm a creep*

*I'm a weirdo*

*What the hell am I doing here?*

*I don't belong here*

*I don't belong here*

##IMAGINE

###by John Lennon

*Imagine there's no heaven*

*It's easy if you try*

*No hell below us*

*Above us only sky*

*Imagine all the people*

*Living for today...*

<br>

*Imagine there's no countries*

*It isn't hard to do*

*Nothing to kill or die for*

*And no religion too*

*Imagine all the people*

*Living life in peace...*

<br>

***You may say I'm a dreamer***

***But I'm not the only one***

*I hope someday you'll join us*

*And the world will be as one*

<br>

*Imagine no possessions*

*I wonder if you can*

*No need for greed or hunger*

*A brotherhood of man*

*Imagine all the people*

*Sharing all the world...*

<br>

***You may say I'm a dreamer***

***But I'm not the only one***

*I hope someday you'll join us*

*And the world will live as one*

##The Times They Are A-Changin

###by Bob Dylan

*Come gather ’round people*

*Wherever you roam*

*And admit that the waters*

*Around you have grown*

*And accept it that soon*

*You’ll be drenched to the bone*

*If your time to you is worth savin’*

*Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone*

*For the times they are a-changin’*

<br>

*Come writers and critics*

*Who prophesize with your pen*

*And keep your eyes wide*

*The chance won’t come again*

*And don’t speak too soon*

*For the wheel’s still in spin*

*And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’*

*For the loser now will be later to win*

*For the times they are a-changin’*

<br>

*Come senators, congressmen*

*Please heed the call*

*Don’t stand in the doorway*

*Don’t block up the hall*

*For he that gets hurt*

*Will be he who has stalled*

*There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’*

*It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls*

*For the times they are a-changin’*

<br>

*Come mothers and fathers*

*Throughout the land*

*And don’t criticize*

*What you can’t understand*

*Your sons and your daughters*

*Are beyond your command*

*Your old road is rapidly agin’*

*Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand*

*For the times they are a-changin’*

<br>

*The line it is drawn*

*The curse it is cast*

*The slow one now*

*Will later be fast*

*As the present now*

*Will later be past*

*The order is rapidly fadin’*

*And the first one now will later be last*

*For the times they are a-changin’*
