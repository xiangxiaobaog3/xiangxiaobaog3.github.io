1. The earlier,the better.And sometimes that can be equal to hard work.

2. No one really cares about what you have done and how many difficulties you pulled through,because only the output does matter.

3. Miracles may happen every day.But shit happens,too.

4. "Do your own best" is not enough,for everyone around you is doing his best.

5. Almost wise saying has an opposite one.No less wise to balance it.

### The Loser Now Will Be Later to Win

adapted from *"The Times They Are A-Changin'"*

--by **Bob Dylan**

The line it is drawn

The curse it is cast

The slow one now

Will later be fast

As the present now

Will later be past

The order is

Rapidly fadin'

And the first one now

Will later be last

For the times they are a-changin'. 

###All That is Gold Does Not Glitter

--by **J.R.R.Tolkien**

All that is gold does not glitter,

Not all those who wander are lost;

The old that is strong does not wither,

Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,

A light from the shadows shall spring;

Renewed shall be blade that was broken,

The crownless again shall be king.
